        <p>Sunsets are instants of intimate and private contemplation. It's a time when we look at each other without mirrors.A sunset tells us what we are and where we should head to. 
            It's a spiritual guide powered by Mother Nature and one that we should never neglect.
            Dusk teaches us to be a better person and choose happiness over wealth, careers, resentment, and lies.
            Sunsets are also intimately connected with love, life, God, friendship, family, the beach, and the ocean.</p>
